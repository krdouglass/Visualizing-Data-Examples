# visualizing data with ggplot2 examples
#
# The purpose of the R scripts in this repository is to demonstrate packages and functions # I often use when visualizing data. These were made mostly for my own reference and as a
# way to practice, so it is far from perfect or comprehensive, but I will share it here for # others who may find it helpful.
